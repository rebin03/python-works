Access modifiers
-----------------

- Python uses the ‘_’ symbol to determine the access control for a specific data member or a member function of a class.
- Access specifiers in Python have an important role to play in securing data from unauthorized access and in preventing it from being exploited.

A Class in Python has three types of access modifiers:

• Public Access Modifier
• Protected Access Modifier
• Private Access Modifier

=> Public Access Modifier:
    - The members of a class that are declared public are easily accessible from any part of the program.
    - All data members and member functions of a class are public by default.

=> Protected Access Modifier:
    - The members of a class that are declared protected are only accessible to a class derived from it.
    - Data members of a class are declared protected by adding a single underscore ‘_’ symbol before the data member of that class. 

=> Private Access Modifier:
    - The members of a class that are declared private are accessible within the class only, private 
    - access modifier is the most secure access modifier.
    - Data members of a class are declared private by adding a double underscore ‘__’ symbol before the data member of that class.
