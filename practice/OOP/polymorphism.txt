Polymorphism
------------

• The word polymorphism means having many forms. 
• In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types. 
• The key difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function.

-> Example of inbuilt polymorphic functions:

    # len() being used for a string
    print(len("geeks"))

    # len() being used for a list
    print(len([10, 20, 30]))

=> In python, polymorphism can achieved by following concept:

    • Duck typing
    • Method overloading
    • Operator overloading
    • Method overriding

1. Duck typing:

    - Duck Typing is a type system used in dynamic languages(Python, Perl, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, etc.)
    - where the type or the class of an object is less important than the method it defines.
    - Using Duck Typing, we do not check types at all. Instead, we check for the presence of a given method or attribute.
    - Therefore, what really matters is if the object has particular attributes at run time.
